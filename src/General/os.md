# Operating Systems: A Structured Overview

## Introduction:

Operating systems are core software programs that manage computer hardware resources and provide a platform for running applications. They act as intermediaries between users and hardware, translating user commands into instructions the hardware can understand.

## Historical Context:

Before operating systems, humans interacted directly with computers, feeding them individual program instructions. This limited computers to running only one program at a time. The development of operating systems enabled users to submit batch jobs, allowing the OS to handle multiple programs sequentially.

## Operating System Functions:

* **Hardware Management:** Controls and allocates hardware resources like memory, CPU, and I/O devices.
* **Resource Sharing:** Enables multiple applications to share hardware resources efficiently.
* **Process Management:** Creates, schedules, and terminates processes, ensuring smooth program execution.
* **Memory Management:** Allocates and manages memory space for applications and system processes.
* **File Management:** Organizes and provides access to data stored on storage devices.
* **Security:** Protects the system from unauthorized access and malicious activities.
* **User Interface:** Provides a platform for users to interact with the system and applications.

## Types of Operating Systems:

* **Batch:** Processes jobs in batches without user intervention.
* **Time-Sharing:** Allows multiple users to share a single computer concurrently.
* **Distributed:** Runs on multiple interconnected computers, coordinating their activities.
* **Network:** Provides network services and communication facilities.
* **Real-Time:** Responds to events and controls processes within strict time constraints.
* **Multiprogramming:** Enables the execution of multiple programs simultaneously.
* **Multitasking:** Allows users to work on multiple tasks concurrently.

## Kernel:

The kernel is the core component of an operating system, acting as the bridge between hardware and other software layers. It performs essential tasks like:

* **Device Management:** Communicates directly with hardware devices and translates user requests.
* **Memory Management:** Allocates and manages memory for different processes and system functions.
* **Process Management:** Schedules and controls the execution of processes.

**Types of Kernels:**

* **Monolithic:** Combines all operating system functionality into a single, large kernel. (e.g., Linux)
* **Micro-kernel:** Provides only essential services in the core and relies on user-space modules for additional functionality. (e.g., Mach)
* **Hybrid:** Combines elements of both monolithic and micro-kernel architectures. (e.g., Windows NT kernel)

## Operating System Examples:

* **Linux:** Popular open-source OS for various platforms.
* **Windows:** Widely used commercial OS for personal computers.
* **macOS:** Apple's proprietary OS for Macintosh computers.
* **Android:** Mobile OS based on Linux, used in smartphones and tablets.
* **iOS:** Apple's mobile OS for iPhones and iPads.

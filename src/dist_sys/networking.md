# Distributed Networking: Connecting the Nodes

This revised and organized document provides a comprehensive overview of distributed networking, focusing on its key aspects and terminology.

### Introduction

**Distributed systems** consist of multiple independent computers, called **nodes**, working together to achieve a common goal. These systems rely on **distributed networking**, which refers to the infrastructure and processes that enable communication and data exchange between nodes.

### Key Concepts

* **Nodes:** Individual computers or servers within the distributed system.
* **Network Operators:** Provide connectivity and data transmission services between nodes.
* **Communication Media:** Channels used for data transmission, including laser, electric cables, radio waves, and even physical storage devices.
* **Latency:** Time taken for data packets to travel from sender to receiver.
* **Bandwidth:** Data volume transferred per unit time, reflecting network capacity.
* **Clients:** Nodes requesting data or services from other nodes.
* **Servers:** Nodes providing data or services to other nodes.

### Communication Workflow

1. **Client Request:** The client initiates communication by sending a request message to the server. This message contains information like headers, content, and protocol details.
2. **Server Processing:** The server receives the request message, processes it, and generates a response message.
3. **Server Response:** The server transmits the response message back to the client, containing any relevant data or information.

### Distributed System Clusters

Nodes in a distributed system are typically grouped into **clusters**, also referred to as **grids** or **clouds**. Different network topologies can be used to connect nodes within the cluster:

* **Bus Topology:** All nodes are connected to a single cable, forming a linear chain.
* **Star Topology:** All nodes are connected to a central hub or switch, resembling a star shape.
* **Mesh Topology:** Nodes are directly connected to each other, creating a web-like structure.
* **Ring Topology:** Nodes are connected in a circular fashion, with each node linked to two others.

### Additional Concepts

* **Protocols:** Define rules and procedures for communication between nodes.
* **Network Devices:** Switches, routers, and other devices help route and manage network traffic.
* **Security:** Protecting data and ensuring secure communication is crucial for distributed systems.
* **Redundancy:** Systems are designed with redundant components to ensure continued operation even if individual nodes fail.

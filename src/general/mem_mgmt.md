# Memory Management

Memory management refers to the process of managing the allocation and de-allocation of volatile memory, which is not performed automatically. This concept is demonstrated in the section on "Volatile Memory Regions" in [Volatile Memory](./memories.md#volatile-memory-regions), particularly in the context of the Heap.

## Automatic Memory Management: Garbage Collector

The garbage collector is a component of programming languages that automatically manages memory allocation and de-allocation. It is responsible for identifying and reclaiming memory that is no longer in use by the program, freeing up resources and preventing memory leaks. This strategy is utilized in languages such as Java, C#, JavaScript, Python, and more. In the case of C#, this strategy is based on the RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) principle.

## Hybrid Memory Management

In hybrid memory management, the ownership-based resource management (OBRM) approach is employed. OBRM is similar to RAII, but in contrast to RAII where the developer chooses to use it, OBRM is built into the language itself. The Rust programming language utilizes the OBRM method for memory management, which contributes to its popularity. This approach helps to avoid many runtime errors, as well as incorrect memory allocations and de-allocations, by catching them at compile-time, albeit at the expense of increased compilation time.

## Manual Memory Management

In contrast, the C programming language handles memory management entirely manually. This means that the programmer is responsible for all memory allocations and de-allocations. While this approach provides full control, it can lead to error-prone code and increased difficulty in maintenance.

## Pros and Cons of Manual Memory Management

Pros:
- Full control over memory management
- Efficiency

Cons:
- Prone to errors
- Tedious and exhausting

## Pros and Cons of Hybrid Manual Memory Management

Pros:
- Full control over memory management
- Efficiency
- Reduced likelihood of errors

Cons:
- Partially tedious and exhausting

## Pros and Cons of Automatic Memory Management

Pros:
- Ease of use
- Reduced likelihood of errors

Cons:
- Lack of control
- Reduced efficiency

## Comparing RAII to OBRM

RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) is a pattern used in C++ to handle memory allocation and de-allocation. It is used when managing resources with finite supply. Examples include heap-allocated memory and network sockets. In the context of classes, RAII involves acquiring resources during initialization and cleaning them up during destruction.

OBRM is similar to RAII but is built into the language and does not allow for manual closing like RAII. In OBRM, ownership rules are checked at compile-time, and each value has only one owner (the variable containing the value). When the owner goes out of scope, the value is automatically dropped and the dropping process is handled accordingly.

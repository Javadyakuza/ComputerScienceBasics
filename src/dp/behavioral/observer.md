The Observer Pattern is a design pattern that establishes a one-to-many relationship between a subject and multiple observers (or listeners). When the subject's state changes, all registered observers are notified and can react accordingly.

### Human Description

Think of it like a speaker at a conference with many listeners. The Observer Pattern sets up a sender (the subject) and multiple receivers (the observers) who act based on predefined rules when the sender updates.

Common methods for implementing the Observer Pattern include:

- **Message Passing with Channels**: e.g., MPSC channels
- **WebSocket Channels**: For real-time updates
- **Asynchronous Updates**: Non-blocking communication
- **Publish-Subscribe Systems**: For managing and distributing messages
- **Event Emitters**: Used in various programming environments

## Implementation Overview

Three main concepts are involved:

    Subject (Sender)
    Receivers (Listeners)
    Communication Method

The sender can be any type that supports sending messages through the chosen channel.

The receiver can be any type that can receive messages from the chosen communication channel.

The methods can be [those mentioned above](#human-description) or any other that meets the requirements of the pattern.

One initialized each one of them and connected to each other, our system can be utilized easily.

# Data Structures

In the simple words a data structure in a methods specifying the way of storing the data in order to set and retrieve it in a efficient way.

1. **Data Types: The Foundations:**
    - **Simple:** Basic units like integers, strings, and booleans.
    - **Compound:** Organized collections of data elements (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs).

2. **Linear Data Structures: Efficient Access and Operations:**
    - **Arrays:** Fixed-size indexed collections, offering fast random access but slow insertions/deletions.
        - **Example:** Storing student grades in a class.
    - **Stacks:** LIFO (Last In, First Out) sequences, ideal for undo/redo operations and function call stacks.
        - **Example:** Balancing parentheses in an expression or managing web browser history.
    - **Queues:** FIFO (First In, First Out) sequences, perfect for processing tasks in order like printing documents.
        - **Example:** Handling customer requests in a call center or managing jobs in a printer queue.
    - **Linked Lists:** Dynamically sized sequences with nodes connected by pointers, offering flexibility but slower random access.
        - **Example:** Representing song playlists or managing memory allocation.

3. **Non-Linear Data Structures: Navigating Relationships and Hierarchies:**
    - **Trees:** Hierarchical structures with parent-child relationships, enabling efficient searching, sorting, and data organization.
        - **Examples:** Representing family lineages, managing file systems, and implementing binary search trees (BSTs) for fast data retrieval.
    - **Graphs:** Collections of nodes connected by edges, ideal for modeling complex relationships, networks, and paths.
        - **Examples:** Representing social networks, transportation maps, and representing dependencies between tasks in a project.



## Beyond the Basics

* **Big O Notation:** Analyzing algorithm efficiency in terms of time and space complexity (e.g., O(n) for linear growth).

* **Big O notation in time complexity:**
- Constant time (O(1)): Operations executed a fixed number of times regardless of input size (e.g., assigning a value to a variable).
- Linear time (O(n)): Loop iterating n times (e.g., iterating through an array of n elements).
- Logarithmic time (O(log n)): Operations involving binary search or comparisons that divide the search space by half in each iteration.
- Polynomial time (O(n^k)): Nested loops or operations iterating n times within another loop k times.

* **Choosing the Right Tool for the Job:** Matching the data structure and algorithm to your data's characteristics and desired operations for optimal performance.

### Bonus:

* **Bitwise Operations:** Manipulating individual bits within data for efficient calculations and optimizations.
* **Recursion:** Solving problems by calling smaller versions of themselves, often leading to elegant and concise solutions.

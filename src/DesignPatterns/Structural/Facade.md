The Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex system, hiding its complexity from the end user by encapsulating multiple functions or classes behind a single, unified interface.

## Humanly Described

Imagine a plumbing and electrical system in a house. The user simply flips a switch to turn on the lights or starts the plumbing system without needing to understand the complex processes happening behind the scenes. They donâ€™t need to know the details; they just use the simple interface.

## Initialization Process

Initializing this pattern is straightforward: you need a set of complex objects and functions, and a wrapper class that consolidates these into a single, user-friendly interface.

## Use Cases & Point of Approach

- Providing ease of use for the end user
- Cleaner and more maintainable code
- Usable and refactorable code
- Hiding implementation details from the user
- Reducing dependencies between subsystems

## Code Samples

> Rust natively doesn't support class creation but this pattern is implementable using another approach.

``` rust
fn execute_task_1() {
    println!("Executing task one...");
}

fn execute_task_2() {
    println!("Executing task two...");
}

pub struct TaskHandler;

impl TaskHandler {
    pub fn perform_basic_task(&self) {
        execute_task_1();
    }

    pub fn perform_advanced_tasks(&self) {
        execute_task_1();
        execute_task_2();
    }
}

fn main() {
    let handler = TaskHandler;
    handler.perform_basic_task();
    handler.perform_advanced_tasks();
}

```

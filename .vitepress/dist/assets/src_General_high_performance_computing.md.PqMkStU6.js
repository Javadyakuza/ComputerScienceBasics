It supports research across various fields, including chemistry, biology, and engineering and etc. HPC systems are available from major cloud providers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, but on-site installations may be necessary for sensitive or large data sets. While prone to errors, HPC plays a crucial role in drug discovery , aerospace and astronomy industry, aerology and other research areas. This document provides a a basic and general overview of HPC, including its building blocks, VM types, storage solutions, networking, costs, and key terminology.</p><h2 id="introduction" tabindex="-1">Introduction: <a class="header-anchor" href="#introduction" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Introduction:&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Historically, researchers solved problems by dividing them among individuals. HPC takes a similar approach, combining the processing power of multiple computers into a single, virtual machine. This significantly increases processing speed and efficiency, paving the way for groundbreaking research in various fields. like the historical example, its like putting the responsibility of a task on thousands of nodes.</p><h3 id="comparison-with-low-performance-computing-lpc" tabindex="-1">Comparison with Low-Performance Computing (LPC): <a class="header-anchor" href="#comparison-with-low-performance-computing-lpc" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Comparison with Low-Performance Computing (LPC):&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Unlike LPC which divides a computer&#39;s resources for multiple users, HPC combines multiple machines into one supercomputer.

These systems rely on <strong>distributed networking</strong>, which refers to the infrastructure and processes that enable communication and data exchange between nodes.</p><h3 id="key-concepts" tabindex="-1">Key Concepts <a class="header-anchor" href="#key-concepts" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Key Concepts&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Nodes:</strong> Individual computers or servers within the distributed system.</li><li><strong>Network Operators:</strong> Provide connectivity and data transmission services between nodes.</li><li><strong>Communication Media:</strong> Channels used for data transmission, including laser, electric cables, radio waves, and even physical storage devices.</li><li><strong>Latency:</strong> Time taken for data packets to travel from sender to receiver.</li><li><strong>Bandwidth:</strong> Data volume transferred per unit time, reflecting network capacity.</li><li><strong>Clients:</strong> Nodes requesting data or services from other nodes.</li><li><strong>Servers:</strong> Nodes providing data or services to other nodes.</li></ul><h3 id="communication-workflow" tabindex="-1">Communication Workflow <a class="header-anchor" href="#communication-workflow" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Communication Workflow&quot;">​</a></h3><ol><li><strong>Client Request:</strong> The client initiates communication by sending a request message to the server. This message contains information like headers, content, and protocol details.</li><li><strong>Server Processing:</strong> The server receives the request message, processes it, and generates a response message.</li><li><strong>Server Response:</strong> The server transmits the response message back to the client, containing any relevant data or information.</li></ol><h3 id="distributed-system-clusters" tabindex="-1">Distributed System Clusters <a class="header-anchor" href="#distributed-system-clusters" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Distributed System Clusters&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Nodes in a distributed system are typically grouped into <strong>clusters</strong>, also referred to as <strong>grids</strong> or <strong>clouds</strong>. Different network topologies can be used to connect nodes within the cluster:</p><ul><li><strong>Bus Topology:</strong> All nodes are connected to a single cable, forming a linear chain.</li><li><strong>Star Topology:</strong> All nodes are connected to a central hub or switch, resembling a star shape.</li><li><strong>Mesh Topology:</strong> Nodes are directly connected to each other, creating a web-like structure.</li><li><strong>Ring Topology:</strong> Nodes are connected in a circular fashion, with each node linked to two others.</li></ul><h3 id="additional-concepts" tabindex="-1">Additional Concepts <a class="header-anchor" href="#additional-concepts" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Additional Concepts&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Protocols:</strong> Define rules and procedures for communication between nodes.</li><li><strong>Network Devices:</strong> Switches, routers, and other devices help route and manage network traffic.</li><li><strong>Security:</strong> Protecting data and ensuring secure communication is crucial for distributed systems.</li><li><strong>Redundancy:</strong> Systems are designed with redundant components to ensure continued operation even if individual nodes fail.</li></ul><h3 id="summary" tabindex="-1">Summary <a class="header-anchor" href="#summary" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Summary&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Distributed networking plays a critical role in enabling communication and collaboration within distributed systems. Understanding its core concepts, infrastructure, and network topologies is essential for building robust and scalable distributed applications.</p><p>This revised document provides a more organized and professional structure, replacing informal terms with technical terminology and improving the overall flow of information. It also incorporates additional concepts relevant to distributed networking.</p>',16),s=[r];function a(d,c,l,u,g,h){return t(),o("div",null,s)}const b=e(i,[["render",a]]);export{p as __pageData,b as default};

It takes all of your source code and translates it into executable machine code. Compilers are designed to be highly efficient and can generate programs that run swiftly.</p><p>One key aspect of compiled programs is that they are typically platform-specific and can only be executed on the particular machine for which the program was compiled. For example, an executable file compiled on a Windows machine cannot be run on a Linux machine. However, this platform dependency can be overcome by using cross-compilation techniques.</p><p>Another advantage of compiled programming languages is the ability to distribute executable files (such as an .exe file) without sharing the actual source code. This allows users to run the program without exposing the underlying code, as the executable file contains the binary representation of the program.</p><h1 id="what-is-an-interpreter-in-programming-languages" tabindex="-1">What is an Interpreter in Programming Languages? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-an-interpreter-in-programming-languages" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What is an Interpreter in Programming Languages?&quot;">​</a></h1><p>An interpreter, on the other hand, executes the source code line by line without the need for prior compilation. It reads each line of code and immediately executes it before moving on to the next line. This process can be slower compared to compiled programs, as the interpretation happens in real-time.</p><p>One advantage of interpreters is their cross-platform compatibility. Interpreted programs can be run on any machine that has the interpreter for that specific language installed. However, a drawback is that the user typically needs access to the source code in order to run the program, which can potentially expose the code to others.</p><h2 id="hybrid-languages" tabindex="-1">Hybrid Languages <a class="header-anchor" href="#hybrid-languages" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Hybrid Languages&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Hybrid languages, also known as bytecode-compiled languages, combine elements of both compilation and interpretation. They are first compiled into an intermediate bytecode representation, which is platform-independent. This bytecode can then be executed on any operating system using a virtual machine (VM) that converts the bytecode into machine-specific binary code at runtime.</p><p>By leveraging bytecode and a VM, hybrid languages offer a balance between platform independence and performance. They allow developers to write code once and run it on different operating systems, as long as the appropriate VM is available. This approach provides a level of portability while still benefiting from the performance advantages of compiled code. <code>Java</code> is such a language.</p>',11),o=[i];function s(c,l,p,d,h,m){return a(),t("div",null,o)}const f=e(n,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,f as default};

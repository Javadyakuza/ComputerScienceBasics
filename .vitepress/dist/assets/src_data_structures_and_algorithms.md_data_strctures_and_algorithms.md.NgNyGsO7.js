Operations: Efficient insertion, deletion, and search (logarithmic time complexity)
Structure: Uses rotations (left and right) to maintain balance after insertions or deletions
Applications: When frequent insertions and deletions occur, and maintaining a balanced tree is crucial for performance.
</code></pre><p>B-Tree:</p><pre><code>Focus: Maximizing data storage and minimizing disk I/O operations
Operations: Efficient search and retrieval (logarithmic time complexity)
Structure: Each node can hold multiple key-value pairs, leading to fewer nodes in the tree and faster search.
Applications: Used in databases and file systems where efficient data storage and retrieval are essential.

This can be a powerful technique for solving complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, self-similar sub-problems.</p></blockquote><p>therefor a algorithm is a sequence of the finite steps to solve a problem.</p><p>types of the algorithms:</p><ol><li><p><em>Brute Force Algorithm</em>: It is the simplest approach for a problem. A brute force algorithm is the first approach that comes to finding when we see a problem. The brute force approach is a guaranteed way to find the correct solution by listing all the possible candidate solutions for the problem.The brute force method is ideal for solving small and simpler problems.</p></li><li><p><em>Recursive Algorithm</em>: A recursive algorithm is based on recursion. In this case, a problem is broken into several sub-parts and called the same function again and again. A recursive function solves a particular problem by calling a copy of itself and solving smaller sub-problems of the original problems. It is essential to know that we should provide a certain case in order to terminate this recursion process.Performing the same operations multiple times with different inputs.In every step, we try smaller inputs to make the problem smaller.(not necessarily).Recursion uses more memory, because the recursive function adds to the stack with each recursive call, and keeps the values there until the call is finished.The recursive function uses LIFO (LAST IN FIRST OUT) Structure just like the stack data structure. <em>What is the difference between direct and indirect recursion?</em> A function fun is called direct recursive if it calls the same function fun. A function fun is called indirect recursive if it calls another function say fun_new and fun_new calls fun directly or indirectly. When any function is called from main(), the memory is allocated to it on the stack. A recursive function calls itself, the memory for a called function is allocated on top of memory allocated to the calling function and a different copy of local variables is created for each function call. When the base case is reached, the function returns its value to the function by whom it is called and memory is de-allocated and the process continues.</p></li></ol><p><em>Recursion VS Iteration</em></p><table><thead><tr><th>Recursion</th><th>Iteration</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Terminates when the base case becomes true.</td><td>Terminates when the condition becomes false.</td></tr><tr><td>Used with functions.</td><td>Used with loops.</td></tr><tr><td>Every recursive call needs extra space in the stack memory.</td><td>Every iteration does not require any extra space.</td></tr><tr><td>Smaller code size.</td><td>Larger code size.</td></tr></tbody></table><ol><li><em>Backtracking Algorithm</em>: The backtracking algorithm basically builds the solution by searching among all possible solutions. Using this algorithm, we keep on building the solution following criteria. Whenever a solution fails we trace back to the failure point and build on the next solution and continue this process till we find the solution or all possible solutions are looked after. Backtracking algo&#39;s types:</li></ol><ul><li><p>Decision Problem – In this, we search for a feasible solution.</p></li><li><p>Optimization Problem – In this, we search for the best solution.</p></li><li><p>Enumeration Problem – In this, we find all feasible solutions.</p></li></ul><p>a back tracking usage example is when solving a sudoku table, we put a digit and then after wards if we saw the number is nit going to be a part of the solution we delete that (backtracking).</p><ol start="3"><li><em>Searching Algorithm</em>: Searching algorithms are the ones that are used for searching elements or groups of elements from a particular data structure. They can be of different types based on their approach or the data structure in which the element should be found.</li></ol><p>searching algorithms:</p><p><em>sequential search</em>: in this list or array is traversed sequentially and every element is checked one by one. is called linear search.</p><p>interval search: this type of the searching algorithm is used for the sorted data database, it is more efficient than the linear</p><ol start="4"><li><p><em>Sorting Algorithm</em>: Sorting is arranging a group of data in a particular manner according to the requirement. The algorithms which help in performing this function are called sorting algorithms. Generally sorting algorithms are used to sort groups of data in an increasing or decreasing manner.A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list of elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of elements in the respective data structure.</p></li><li><p><em>Hashing Algorithm</em>: Hashing algorithms work similarly to the searching algorithm. But they contain an index with a key ID. In hashing, a key is assigned to specific data. Hashing refers to the process of generating a fixed-size output from an input of variable size using the mathematical formulas known as hash functions. This technique determines an index or location for the storage of an item in a data structure. the hash data structure are the fixed length array kinda that provides us the constant time complexity.</p></li><li><p><em>Divide and Conquer Algorithm (DAC)</em>: This algorithm breaks a problem into sub-problems, solves a single sub-problem and merges the solutions together to get the final solution. It consists of the following three steps:</p></li></ol><p>Divide: This involves dividing the problem into smaller sub-problems. Conquer: Solve sub-problems by calling recursively until solved. Combine: Combine the sub-problems to get the final solution of the whole problem.</p><ol start="7"><li><p><em>Greedy Algorithm</em>: In this type of algorithm the solution is built part by part. The solution of the next part is built based on the immediate benefit of the next part. The one solution giving the most benefit will be chosen as the solution for the next part.</p></li><li><p><em>Dynamic Programming Algorithm</em>: This algorithm uses the concept of using the already found solution to avoid repetitive calculation of the same part of the problem. It divides the problem into smaller overlapping sub-problems and solves them. is to calculate the the solution of the sub problem and accessing them later instead of recomputing them. this wil gives us a linear computation time complexity while that sub problem result computation on each time will gives us a exponential time complexity.</p></li><li><p><em>Randomized Algorithm</em>: In the randomized algorithm we use a random number so it gives immediate benefit. The random number helps in deciding the expected outcome. An algorithm that uses random numbers to decide what to do next anywhere in its logic is called Randomized Algorithm. For example, in Randomized Quick Sort, we use a random number to pick the next pivot (or we randomly shuffle the array). Typically, this randomness is used to reduce time complexity or space complexity in other standard algorithms.</p></li></ol><p>these were the common types of the algorithms.</p><h2 id="bfs" tabindex="-1">BFS <a class="header-anchor" href="#bfs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;BFS&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm is used to search a graph data structure for a node that meets a set of criteria.

Then again the first node is popped out and then it’s child nodes are put in a FIFO queue and repeat until queue becomes empty.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The Boundary Traversal of a Tree includes: left boundary (nodes on left excluding leaf nodes) leaves (consist of only the leaf nodes) right boundary (nodes on right excluding leaf nodes)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Diagonal Traversal In the Diagonal Traversal of a Tree, all the nodes in a single diagonal will be printed one by one.</p></blockquote><h2 id="bitwise-algorithm" tabindex="-1">bitwise algorithm: <a class="header-anchor" href="#bitwise-algorithm" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;bitwise algorithm:&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The Bitwise Algorithms is used to perform operations at the bit-level or to manipulate bits in different ways. The bitwise operations are found to be much faster and are sometimes used to improve the efficiency of a program.</p><p>For example: To check if a number is even or odd. This can be easily done by using Bitwise-AND(&amp;) operator. If the last bit of the operator is set than it is ODD otherwise it is EVEN. Therefore, if num &amp; 1 not equals to zero than num is ODD otherwise it is EVEN.</p>`,152),r=[n];function o(l,h,d,p,c,u){return t(),a("div",null,r)}const k=e(s,[["render",o]]);export{g as __pageData,k as default};
